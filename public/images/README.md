# Images Folder

This folder is for storing images used throughout the website.

## How to add images:

1. In Dev Mode, you can add images directly to this folder or its subfolders.
2. Reference images using the path: `/images/your-image-name.jpg`

## Folder Structure:

- `/images/` - Main images folder
  - `/hero/` - Images for hero sections
  - `/instructors/` - Images of instructors
  - `/gallery/` - Images for the gallery section
  - `/blog/` - Images for blog/newsletter posts
  - `/icons/` - Icon images

## Example Usage in Code:

```jsx
// Using an image in a React component
<img src="/images/hero/banner.jpg" alt="Hero Banner" />
```

This structure helps keep images organized by their purpose.
